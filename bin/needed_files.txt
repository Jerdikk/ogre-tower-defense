The following files are not checked in with the project because they could be different
from machine to machine (ie, different versions of Ogre, different configuration options,
etc.)  They can all be found by default in your OgreSDK or Ogre source folder and should
be copied to this directory.  Remember to get the debug and release versions of the DLLs)
